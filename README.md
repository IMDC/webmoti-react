- Two main files main.py and index.html.
- The PICO board needs both files but will autorun the file main.py.
- Once code and local hotspot is running from the PICO; Use any touchscreen device to connect to this network and hosted webpage. 
- Clicking on any of the 5x4 grid boxes will allow proper communication to the microphone.

 RaiseHand Function
 ===============================
 ------------------------------------------
 - Two files hosted locally on a PICO
 - Main.py and index.html
 - Runs on hotspot connection via Raspberry Pi plugged in via ETH
 - Once connection is made allow that connection to be made globally via: https://www.remote.it/getting-started/raspberry-pi
 - your routing for the link on the board must be [WEBPAGE IP].com/raisehand; once properly entered remote.it will provide a live link.
 - Raising your hand is now possible via the locally hosted code, hotspot connection, and proper remote.it IP routing
